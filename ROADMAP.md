# 1. Implement Basic Concept:

* OceanWorld (Grid & Environment)
* HydrothermalVent (Energy Producer)
* Lifeform (Energy Consumer)
* Simulation (Simulate & Plotting Graphs)

# 2. Implement Varied Concept:

* OceanWorld (with sunlight on/off switch)
* Different Types of Energy Producers
* Different Types of Lifeforms
* Simulation (2 modes for sunlight on/off)

# 3. Implement Complex Concept:

* Introduce Evolution (Survive longer + reproduce)
* Introduce Environmental Changes (Production rate of chemicals can vary)
* Multiple types of chemicals for chemosynthesis-driven world
